  booktitle = {Cloud Computing (CLOUD), 2012 IEEE 5th International Conference on},
  year = {2012},
  pages = {962-969},
  abstract = {The current growth in embedded ICT infrastructure, driven by visions
	such as the "Smart Cities" concept, is leading to the deployment
	of a wide range of embedded systems in our environment, which motivates
	the need for a reusable, flexible and manageable Wireless Sensor
	Network or WSN infrastructure. However, to simplify the system operation
	and maintenance as well as to reduce costs, WSNs mus become an infrastructure
	that is capable of providing services to multiple end users concurrently,
	rather than having to roll out individual infrastructures for specific
	purposes. Here, we present the concept of a WSN infrastructure as
	a WSN Cloud, which provides services to multiple application and
	data collection systems which adheres to the cloud computing paradigm.
	Each instance of the WSN Cloud (i.e. a specific set of services configured
	by a particular end user/system) utilises the WSN infrastructure
	as if it was a unique network provisioned for their specific requirements.
	This realisation of the WSN Cloud as Network as a Service or NaaS
	requires the WSN to support a service orientated software architecture
	allowing other systems to provision the WSN infrastructure for their
	needs with NaaS allowing multiple systems to use the WSN uniquely
	and concurrently. The WSN-Service Orchestration Architecture "WSN-SOrA"
	presented here is a novel approach to orchestrate service provisioning
	for embedded networked systems, and enables WSNs to act as cloud
	ready infrastructures that facilitate on-demand provisioning for
	potentially multiple individual backend systems.},

  booktitle = {Cloud Computing (CLOUD), 2012 IEEE 5th International Conference on},

  pages = {327-335},
  abstract = {CPU and device virtualization technology allows applications to be
	hosted on cloud platforms; some of the resulting benefits are lower
	cost and greater elasticity. In such cloud hosted applications, some
	components reside on the cloud while others, such as end users and
	components tied to physical devices, are located outside the cloud.
	Many applications, e.g., telecom services, have stringent latency
	requirements in terms of within how much time certain procedures
	must be completed. The application latency is strongly determined
	by the locations of all the interacting components that are both
	within and outside the cloud. In this paper, we study the problem
	of determining the optimal placement of the application components
	in the cloud so that the latency requirements of the application
	can be met. We present a precise formulation of the placement problem
	which includes a specification of the cloud platform, and collective
	latency expressions for application-level latency requirements. We
	show that Message Sequence Charts (MSCs), a widely-used mechanism
	for describing the execution of application procedures, can be naturally
	translated into our formalism of collective latency expressions.
	We present placement algorithms that exploit the Euclidean triangular
	inequality property of network topologies: (a) an exact algorithm
	for determining the most optimal placement but which has a worst-case
	exponential running time, and (b) an algorithm for determining a
	close to-optimal placement that has a fast polynomial running time.
	Additionally, we present an exact technique for partitioning a placement
	problem into smaller sub problems so that greater efficiency and
	accuracy can be achieved. We evaluate the performance of the algorithms
	on a representative telecom application --- a distributed deployment
	of the LTE Mobility Management Entity (MME). Our evaluation results
	show that our approximate algorithm can outperform a random placement
	by up to 49% for finding a success- ul placement.},

  abstract = {The crucial role that networking plays in Cloud computing calls for
	a holistic vision that allows combined control, management, and optimization
	of both networking and computing resources in a Cloud environment,
	which leads to a convergence of networking and Cloud computing. Network
	virtualization is being adopted in both telecommunications and the
	Internet as a key attribute for the next generation networking. Virtualization,
	as a potential enabler of profound changes in both communications
	and computing domains, is expected to bridge the gap between these
	two fields. Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA), when applied in
	network virtualization, enables a Network-as-a-Service (NaaS) paradigm
	that may greatly facilitate the convergence of networking and Cloud
	computing. Recently the application of SOA in network virtualization
	has attracted extensive interest from both academia and industry.
	Although numerous relevant research works have been published, they
	are currently scattered across multiple fields in the literature,
	including telecommunications, computer networking, Web services,
	and Cloud computing. In this article we present a comprehensive survey
	on the latest developments in service-oriented network virtualization
	for supporting Cloud computing, particularly from a perspective of
	network and Cloud convergence through NaaS. Specifically, we first
	introduce the SOA principle and review recent research progress on
	applying SOA to support network virtualization in both telecommunications
	and the Internet. Then we present a framework of network-Cloud convergence
	based on service-oriented network virtualization and give a survey
	on key technologies for realizing NaaS, mainly focusing on state
	of the art of network service description, discovery, and composition.
	We also discuss the challenges brought in by network-Cloud convergence
	to these technologies and research opportunities available in these
	areas, with a hope to arouse the research community's interest -
	n this emerging interdisciplinary field.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose a link layer design for mobile hotspots.
	We design a novel system architecture that enables high-speed Internet
	access in railway systems. The proposed design uses a number of repeaters
	placed along the track and multiple antennas installed on the roof
	of a vehicle. Each packet is decomposed into smaller fragments and
	relayed to the vehicle via adjacent repeaters. We also use erasure
	coding to add parity fragments to original data. This approach is
	called information raining since fragments are rained upon the vehicle
	from adjacent repeaters. We investigate two instances of information
	raining. In blind information raining, all repeaters awaken when
	they sense the presence of the vehicle. The fragments are then blindly
	transmitted via awakened repeaters. A vehicle station installed inside
	the train is responsible for aggregating a large enough number of
	fragments. In the throughput-optimized information raining, the vehicle
	station selects a bipartite matching between repeaters and roof-top
	antennas and activates only a subset of the repeaters. It also dictates
	the amount of transmission power of each activated repeater. Both
	the bipartite matching and power allocations are individually shown
	to be NP-complete. Matching heuristics based on the Hungarian algorithm
	and Gale-Shapley algorithm are proposed. A simplex-type algorithm
	is proposed as the power allocation heuristics.},

	The HWNs information properties dispersion model based on coverage

	and mobile P2P integration a reliable mobile cloud computing service
	can perform services and resources exchange among peer nodes. In

  abstract = {The telecom networks have undergone a massive transformation in last
	few decades from all-voice circuit-switched network to all-IP packet-switched
	network that is converging voice and data worlds. The evolution of
	the telecom networks have also driven the evolution of Service Delivery
	Platforms (SDP) from in-flexible single-box solution to a flexible,
	modular SOA governed SDP to cater the ever changing business needs
	of the Telcos. The fourth generation SDP is taking shape around cloud
	computing with an expectation to significantly reduce OPEX and CAPEX,
	and boost the revenue. But this is not happening because in the current
	scenario where SDPs are hosted on private cloud in Telcos' own premises
	prohibit sharing and reuse. So Telcos have started transitioning
	to a hosted model in which VAS applications are hosted in SDP vendor's
	premises in public cloud. Hosting telecom services in public cloud
	has its unique challenges, and one of the most important is to provide
	a multi-tenant telecom application to all Telcos, where each tenant
	sees an isolated view of the application with his own set of customized
	features. In this paper we have identified the factors that are stopping
	us from introducing true customized multi-tenancy in telecom apps
	and proposed a solution to this problem. We have presented a variant
	of cloud's SaaS layer called Telecom-SaaS (TSaaS) for telecom public
	cloud, which introduces a TSaaS-engine to drive the multi-tenancy
	for carrier grade telecom applications outside the actual business
	logic. New business models that can evolve around this new architecture
	are also identified. We have also highlighted the associated risks
	to watch out for.},

  abstract = {Cloud computing is fundamentally altering the expectations for how
	and when computing, storage and networking resources should be allocated,
	managed and consumed. End-users are increasingly sensitive to the
	latency of services they consume. Service Developers want the Service
	Providers to ensure or provide the capability to dynamically allocate
	and manage resources in response to changing demand patterns in real-time.
	Ultimately, Service Providers are under pressure to architect their
	infrastructure to enable real-time end-to-end visibility and dynamic
	resource management with fine grained control to reduce total cost
	of ownership while also improving agility. The current approaches
	to enabling real-time, dynamic infrastructure are inadequate, expensive
	and not scalable to support consumer mass-market requirements. Over
	time, the server-centric infrastructure management systems have evolved
	to become a complex tangle of layered systems designed to automate
	systems administration functions that are knowledge and labor intensive.
	This expensive and non-real time paradigm is ill suited for a world
	where customers are demanding communication, collaboration and commerce
	at the speed of light. Thanks to hardware assisted virtualization,
	and the resulting decoupling of infrastructure and application management,
	it is now possible to provide dynamic visibility and control of services
	management to meet the rapidly growing demand for cloud-based services.
	What is needed is a rethinking of the underlying operating system
	and management infrastructure to accommodate the ongoing transformation
	of the data center from the traditional server-centric architecture
	model to a cloud or network-centric model. This paper proposes and
	describes a reference model for a network-centric datacenter infrastructure
	management stack that borrows and applies key concepts that have
	enabled dynamism, scalability, reliability and security in the telecom
	industry, to the computing industry. Finally- - , the paper will
	describe a proof-of-concept system that was implemented to demonstrate
	how dynamic resource management can be implemented to enable real-time
	service assurance for network centric datacenter architecture.2010},

	bandwidth heterogeneity, and Zipf-like channel popularity. We apply
	the queueing network models to two P2P streaming designs: the isolated
	channel design (ISO) and the View-Upload Decoupling (VUD) design.
	For both of these designs, we develop efficient algorithms to calculate
	critical performance measures, develop an asymptotic theory to provide
	closed-form results when the number of peers approaches infinity,
	and derive near- optimal provisioning rules for assigning peers to
	groups in VUD. We use the analytical results to compare VUD with

abstract={The rapid advancement and deployment of Web applications call for a precise yet simple model for capacity planning and analysis purposes. The most widely deployed Web application architecture is the 3-tiered system, which is composed of a front-end Web server, an application server and a backend database server. In this paper, we present an analytical model of the 3-tiered Web application architecture. We show by using queueing network theory, we can model the 3-tiered Web application architecture accurately. A test-bed is built to measure model parameters based on industry standard server components and TPC-W benchmark. Validation results show that the proposed model predicts performance measures such as response time and throughput accurately.},
